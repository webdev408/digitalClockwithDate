    <h1>Date and Time App</h1>
    <p>
      This app is prepared using no third party libraries, frameworks and
      contents but pure vanilla Javascript. In doing so, we have written the
      most succicient codes that are scalable and readable.The entire code is
      completed withing 15 lines and in one page. The UI is simple with a couple
      of span tags. The functionality is achieved with a single function
      displayTime.
    </p>
    <div class="time">
      <span id="hms"></span>
      <span id="ampm"></span>
      <br />
      <span id="date"></span>
    </div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
